# Hi!

My name is Kacper, 

I was born in 2000. And in 2018 I've passed my final exams (HAVO) at Mondriaan College in Oss.

Now, I'm expanding my IT knowledge at Fontys Hogescholen in Tilburg. It is my 2nd-year Software Development.

Tinkering with electronics is in my blood. Since I can remember, I was always curious about how my toys looked from the inside out. I always wanted to see it with my own eyes, so I unscrew every toy to admire it from inside.

A few years later (12-13y) when I've got my first notebook, I saw my nephew making a mod for a game. I could not stand that he was using some batch files to install/patch and run a game with his mod. So I suggested that I can make a game launcher for him.

The launcher was my first "serious" project, it was written in `C#`. This was also my first time using this language.
It was challenging, starting with small steps, steps were getting bigger and bigger as I understood more and more of `C#`

#### Languages

While using `C#`, I've learned `PHP`, because I needed it for a little launcher's backend.

After this project, it went in all directions
- `c/cpp` because I've started tinkering with Arduino
- `python` because I wanted to try something else for backend

With these languages, I've most experience, but I've worked with `node.JS` and `Java` too.

#### Hobby's

I find it especially nice to program things but tinkering with microcontrollers and sensors is very interesting too!
